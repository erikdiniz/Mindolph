# V1.5 Release Note

### New Features

* Theme Support for Mind Map  
![v1.5-theme.png](v1.5-theme.jpg)  
As of 1.5, the mind map editor supports themes. Two new pre-defined themes `Light` and `Dark` are introduced, the old style has now become `Classic` theme. You can also custom your own theme by copying any existing theme(either pre-defined or custom).  
If you newly installed v1.5, the default Theme is `Light`; If you upgrad from an old version, a new custom theme called `default` will be created automatically with your previous style preferences.   
In the new version, the topic connector style is able to choose between the new `Bezier` style and the classic `Polyline` style, which can make mind maps look much better.

* Mind Map Embedded Image Preview and Resizing  

	A new preview and resizing dialog has been added for inserting images to mind map topics from clipboard or disk. You can scale image to the appropriate size for mind map topic. (Please note that once you have inserted the scaled image to a mind map, it can't be edited and resized again.)
